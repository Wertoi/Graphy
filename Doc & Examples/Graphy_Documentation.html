    <h2>Marking height</h2>
    <p>
        Number which defines the height of the marking in the current Catia length unit.
        <br />
        Value must be strictly superior to 0.
    </p>

    <h2>Extrusion height</h2>
    <p>
        Number which defines the height of the extrusion in the current Catia length unit.
        <br />
        - Negative value for substracting the marking body of the main body in the +Z direction of the reference axis system.
        <br />
        - Positive value for adding the marking body to the main body in the -Z direction of the reference axis system.
    </p>

    <h2>Horizontal alignment</h2>
    <p>
        Integer value which defines the horizontal alignment of the marking compared to the reference point and the X axis direction.
        <br />
        - 0: for left alignment.

        - The axis system origin must be the reference point.
        <br />
        - The X axis must be the tangent to the tracking curve passing by the reference point. Its direction points the marking direction (left to right for example).
        <br />
        - The Y axis is the result of X and Z axis. Its direction defines the top and the bottom.
        <br />
        - The Z axis must be the normal of the projection surface passing by the reference point. Its direction points the matter adding direction.
