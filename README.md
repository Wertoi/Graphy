# Graphy

## General Info
Graphy allows you to write 3D texts easily in Catia V5 on complex surfaces and directions.
Text obtained can be kept as a surface or in volume but cannot be modified directly in Catia.
Graphy only uses Generative Shape Design module; it does not need other specific Catia V5 license and supports all Windows fonts.

From version v3.2, it has been tested with Catia V5 R19, R20 and R28.
Work fine if compiled with the associated reference Catia dlls:
- INFITF.dll
- PARTITF.dll
- HybridShapeTypeLib.dll
- SPATypeLib.dll
- MECMOD.dll
- KnowledgewareTypeLib.dll
